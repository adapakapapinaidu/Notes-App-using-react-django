# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more info.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is optimized for performance. See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for details.

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. It removes the single build dependency from your project and gives you full control over the configuration files. Use only if needed.
